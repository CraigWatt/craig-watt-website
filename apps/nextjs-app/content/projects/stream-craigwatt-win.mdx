stream.craigwatt.win is my self-hosted video streaming platform, built to run reliably on a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes (k3s) cluster.

It’s designed as a practical, production-style home-lab deployment: automated, repeatable, observable, and resilient — with a focus on real-world streaming performance (direct play where possible, predictable networking, and clean storage workflows).

## What I Built

- **Raspberry Pi k3s cluster** — multi-node Kubernetes cluster as the compute foundation.
- **Jellyfin on Kubernetes** — containerised media server deployment with persistent storage.
- **MetalLB** — stable, LAN-friendly load balancing so services get proper IPs on the local network.
- **Ingress / routing** — ingress setup (e.g. Traefik) to expose services cleanly and consistently.
- **Persistent storage layer** — storage provisioned and managed for media libraries (e.g. Longhorn-backed PVCs where appropriate).
- **Automation-first** — Ansible playbooks/roles to bootstrap nodes, apply configs, and keep deployments reproducible.
- **Operational guard rails** — deployments and upgrades designed to avoid foot-guns (idempotency, safe defaults, clear separation of concerns).

## Engineering Highlights

- **Reproducible cluster build** — new nodes can be provisioned consistently via automation rather than manual steps.
- **Clean separation of concerns** — cluster bootstrap, platform services, and app workloads are managed independently.
- **Networking that behaves** — MetalLB avoids “random NodePort” mess and makes LAN access predictable.
- **Storage decisions made deliberately** — media libraries and config are handled as first-class persistent concerns.

## Why It Matters

This project is a realistic demonstration of how I build and run systems:

- Infrastructure as code (repeatable builds, not “hand-crafted” servers)
- Kubernetes fundamentals applied pragmatically
- Operational reliability and upgradeability as design goals
- A home-lab that behaves like a small production environment
