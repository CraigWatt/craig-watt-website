craigwatt.co.uk is my personal website, designed and built from the ground up  
using **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **HeroUI**.  
It serves as both a technical portfolio and a demonstration of modern web development practices,  
showcasing my ability to architect, scale, and deploy responsive frontends using current industry standards.

## Key Features

- **Built with Next.js App Router (v15)** — leveraging React Server Components, dynamic routing, and async/streaming rendering for a fast, modern experience.  
- **Tailwind CSS + HeroUI** — clean, consistent design system built with utility-first styling and accessible UI primitives.  
- **MDX-Powered Content** — project and blog content authored in MDX, with embedded `<Snippet />` and `<ProjectImage />`.  
- **Composable Component Architecture** — reusable components like `ProjectRenderer`, `ProjectClient`, and `SiteBreadcrumbs`.  
- **Deployed on FluidCloud via Kubernetes** — IaC via Helm & Ansible, CI/CD for zero-downtime deploys.

## Engineering Highlights

- **Content Collections + Dynamic MDX** — build-time MDX with type-safe frontmatter via [content-collections](https://github.com/content-collections).  
- **Dynamic Client/Server Segregation** — interactive bits load client-side (via `<ProjectClient />`), the rest stays in RSC for maximum performance.  
- **Developer Experience** — monorepo (Nx), ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, plus Storybook, Playwright & Jest for testing.

## MDX & Content Collections Setup

To power MDX with frontmatter and hook into content collections, we extend Next’s config:

<Snippet
  symbol=""
  classNames={{ base: "mt-4", pre: "whitespace-pre-wrap" }}
>
{`// apps/nextjs-app/next.config.js
const createMDX = require('@next/mdx');
const remarkFrontmatter    = require('remark-frontmatter').default || require('remark-frontmatter');
const remarkMdxFrontmatter = require('remark-mdx-frontmatter').default || require('remark-mdx-frontmatter');
const { withContentCollections } = require('@content-collections/next');

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
let nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['ts','tsx','js','jsx','md','mdx'],
  output: 'standalone',
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  extension: /\\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter, [remarkMdxFrontmatter,{name:'frontMatter'}]],
  },
});

module.exports = withContentCollections(
  withMDX(nextConfig)
);`}
</Snippet>

This setup does a few things:

- **`createMDX`** integrates MDX into Next, so you can import `.mdx` pages directly.  
- **`remarkFrontmatter`** + **`remark-mdx-frontmatter`** let you author YAML-style frontmatter that MDX can consume as `frontMatter`.  
- **`withContentCollections`** wires that frontmatter into your typed content-collections system at build time.  
- **`pageExtensions`** ensures Next recognizes `.md`, `.mdx` (as well as your TS/JS files) as valid pages.

## Why It Matters

This site isn’t just a static résumé.  
It’s a living example of how I think, structure codebases, solve problems, and design for maintainability —  
applying the same principles I ship in production applications.
